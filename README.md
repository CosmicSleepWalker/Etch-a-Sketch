# Etch-a-Sketch

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
    - Create the divs using JavaScript.
    - Put your grid squares inside a “container” div.
    - Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid.
    - Be careful with borders and margins.
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them.
- Add a button that asks for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
    - Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100.
